Given a string, write a Java function to check if it is palindrome or not. A string is said to be palindrome if reverse of the string is same as string. For example, “abba” is palindrome, but “abbc” is not palindrome. The problem here is solved using string reverse function.

Examples:

Input : malayalam
Output : Yes

Input : GeeksforGeeks
Output : No
