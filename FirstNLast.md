Find first and last positions of an element in a sorted array
Given a sorted array with possibly duplicate elements, the task is to find indexes of first and last occurrences of an element x in the given array.

Examples:

Input : arr[] = {1, 3, 5, 5, 5, 5 ,67, 123, 125}    
        x = 5
Output : First Occurrence = 2
         Last Occurrence = 5

Input : arr[] = {1, 3, 5, 5, 5, 5 ,7, 123 ,125 }    
        x = 7
Output : First Occurrence = 6
         Last Occurrence = 6
